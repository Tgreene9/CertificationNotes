| Trait           | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Prevents disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems |
| Integrity       | Messages can't be modified without detection                              |
| Availability    | Systems and networks must be up and running                               |
#### Confidentiality
* Certain information should only be known to certain people
	* Prevents unauthorized information disclosure
* There are many mechanisms to ensure confidentiality
	* *Encryption:* Encoding messages so only certain people can read it
	* *Access Controls:* Selectively restrict access to a resource
	* *Two-Factor Authentication:* Additional confirmation before information is disclosed

#### Integrity
* Data is stored and transferred as intended
	* Any modification to the data would be identified
* There are many mechanisms to ensure integrity
	* *Hashing:* Maps data data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length
	* *Digital Signature*: Mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data
	* *Certificates:* Combines with a digital signature to verify an individual
	* *Non-repudiation:* Provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine

#### Availability
* Information is accessible to authorized users
* There are many mechanisms to ensure availability
	* *Redundancy:* Build services that will always be available
	* *Fault Tolerance:* System will continue to run, even when a failure occurs
	* *Patching*: Ensures stability and closes security loopholes
