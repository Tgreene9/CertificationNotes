* *Non-repudiation* is the ability to not deny what you've said
	* Verify information came from the sender
	* Similar to a contract, our signature adds non-repudiation
* For Cryptography, non-repudiation adds a proof of integrity and a proof of origin with high assurance of authenticity

#### Proof of Integrity
* Verify data does not change, the data remains accurate and consistent 
* In Cryptography, we use a hash
	* *hash:* Represents data as a short string of text, can also be called a message digest or fingerprint
	* If the data changes, the hash changes
* A hash doesn't necessarily associate data with an individual, it can only tell you if the data has changed

#### Proof of Origin
* Prove the source of the message
	* Authentication
* Ensures the signature isn't fake, offers non-repudiation
* Sign with the *private key*, only the user should have their own private key
* Verify with the *public key*
	* Any changes to the message with invalidate the signature

#### Digital Signatures
* *Digital Signatures* are a combination of the hashed plaintext and encrypted hash
	* The plaintext is hashed for proof of integrity
	* The ciphertext is encrypted with the private key for proof of origin
	* The ciphertext is first decoded with the public key for non-repudiation
	* The original hash is compared to the hash of what the user recieved to ensure proof of integrity
