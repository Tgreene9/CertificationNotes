* There are many categories and types of security risks out there. Assets can be varied in nature
	* Data, physical property, computer systems
* *Security Controls* exist to prevent security events, minimize the impact, and limit the damage 

| Controls             | Implementation                                                             | Example                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Technical Controls   | Controls implemented using systems. Operating system controls              | Firewalls, anti-virus                            |
| Managerial Controls  | Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation | Security policies, standard operating procedures |
| Operational Controls | Controls implemented by people instead of systems                          | Security guards, awareness programs              |
| Physical Controls    | Limit physical access                                                      | Guard shack, fences, locks, badge readers        |

| Corrective   | Apply a Control after an event has been detected, reverse impact of event or continue with minimal downtime |
| Compensating | Control using other means, existing controls aren't sufficient. May be temporary                            |
| Directive    | Direct a subject towards security compliance                                                                |
