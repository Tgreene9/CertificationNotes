* *Gap Analysis* is a study of "where we are" compared to "where we want to be" and the "gap" between them
* This is often an extensive amount of research that can weeks or months 
	* Could include emails, data gathering, and technical research

#### Baselines

	* NIST Special Publication 800-171 Revision 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations
	* ISO/IEC 27001, Information Security Management Systems

	* Baseline employees
		* Formal training
		* Current training
		* Knowledge of security policies and procedures
	* Baseline processes
		* Research existing IT systems
		* Evaluate existing security policies
* Compare and Contrast
	* Evaluate existing systems to identify weaknesses
	* Provides a detailed analysis where broad security categories are examined and broken down into smaller segments

#### Analysis & Report
* Final comparison of detailed baseline objectives
* Provides a path to get from the current security to the goal
* Gap Analysis is a formal description of current state and recommendation for meeting the baseline
