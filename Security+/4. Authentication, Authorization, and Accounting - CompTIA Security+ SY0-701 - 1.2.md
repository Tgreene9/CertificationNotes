#### Authorization Models
* Once a user is authenticated, an authorization model is applied to determine access levels
* Users and Services -> Data and Applications
	* Associate individual users to access rights does not scale in large companies
	* May change often depending on user, manually set each resource per each person scales exponentially
* Put an authorization model in the middle
	* Define by Roles, Organizations, Attributes, etc.
	* Adds an abstraction
		* Define group such as *Shipping and Receiving* that has access to all *resources* related to Shipping and Receiving services
