## HTTP Fundamentals
### HyperText Transfer Protocol
* Today, the majority of the applications we constantly interact with the internet, both web and mobile applications
* Most Internet communications are made with web requests through the HTTP Protocol
	* HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources
	* The term *hypertext* stands for text containing links to other resources and text that readers can easily interpret
* HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the request and returns the requested resource.
	* The default port for HTTP communication is port *80*
* The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We enter a *Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)* as a *Uniform Resource Locator (URL)* to reach the desired website. Resources over HTTP are accessed via a URL
#### The Structure of A URL

| Component    | Example           | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme       | http:// https://  | This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash                                                                 |
| User Info    | admin:password@   | This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon) used to authenticate to the host, and is separated from the host with an at sign *@*      |
| Host         | inlanefreight.com | The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address                                                                                            |
| Port         | :80               | The Port is separated from the Host by a colon. If no port is specified, http schemes default to port *80* and https default to port *443*                                   |
| Path         | /dashboard.php    | This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index (e.g. *index.html*)         |
| Query String | ?login=true       | The query string starts with a question mark, and consists of a parameter (e.g. *login*) and a value (e.g. *true*). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand *&* |
| Fragments    | #status           | Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client side to location sections within the primary resource (e.g. a header or section on the page)                           |
* Not all components are required to access a resource. The main mandatory fields are the scheme and the host, without which the request would have no resource to request.

#### HTTP Flow
![[Pasted image 20250313225220.png]]
* The diagram above presents the anatomy of an HTTP request at a very high level. The first time a user enters the URL (*inlanefreight.com*) into the browser, it sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain and get its IP. The DNS server looks up an IP address for *inlanefreight.com* and returns it. All domain names need to be resolved this way, as a server can't communicate without an IP address. 
	* Browsers often look up records in the local */etc/hosts* file, and if the requested domain does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers. We can use the */etc/hosts* to manually add records to for DNS resolution, by adding the IP followed by the domain name. 
* Once the browser gets the IP address linked to the requested domain, it sends a *GET* request to the default HTTP port asking for the root */* path. Then the web server receives the request and processes it. By default, servers are configured to return an index file when a request for */* is received.
* In the diagram, the contents of *index.html* are read and returned by the web server as an HTTP response. The response also contains the status code (e.g. *200 OK*), which indicates that the request was successfully processed. The web browser then renders the index.html contents and presents it to the user.

#### cURL
* *cURL* (client URL) is a command-line tool and library that primarily supports HTTP along with many other protocols. This makes it a good candidate for scripts as well as automation, making it essential for sending various types of web requests from the command line, which is necessary for many types of web penetration tests.
* A Basic HTTP request to any URL can be done by providing the URL as an argument
```shell-session
greeneTea@htb[/htb]$ curl inlanefreight.com

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
...SNIP...
```
* cURL does not render the HTML/CSS/Javascript code, unlike a web browser, but prints it in its raw format. Generally as a web penetration tester, we are more interested in the request and response context.
### HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
* A significant drawback to HTTP is that all data is transferred in clear-text. This means that anyone between the source and destination can perform a *Man-in-the-middle* (MiTM) attack to view the transferred data. 
* To resolve this issue, the *HTTPS (HTTP Secure) Protocol* was created, in which all communications are transferred in an encrypted format, so even if a third party does intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it. For this reason, HTTPS has become the mainstream scheme for websites on the Internet with HTTP being phased out.

#### HTTPS Overview
![[Pasted image 20250313232222.png]]
* Above is the PCAP of HTTP Traffic, we can see the login credentials can be viewed in clear-text making it easy for someone on the same network (such as a public wireless network) to capture the request and reuse the credentials for malicious purposes.
![[Pasted image 20250313232339.png]]
* In contrast, when someone intercepts and analyzes traffic from an HTTPS request, they would see something like the PCAP above. The data is transferred as a single encrypted stream making it difficult for anyone to capture information such as credentials or any other sensitive data.
	* Although data transferred through the HTTPS protocol may be encrypted, the request may still reveal the visited URL if it contacted a clear-text DNS server. For this reason, it is recommended to utilize encrypted DNS servers or utilize a VPN service to ensure all traffic is properly encrypted

#### HTTPS Flow
![[Pasted image 20250313234256.png]]
* If a user types *http://* instead of *https://* to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to resolve the domain and redirects the user to the web server hosting the target website. A request is sent to port *80* first, when is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the client to secure HTTPS port *443* instead. This is done via a *301 Moved Permanently* response code.
* The client (web browser) sends a "client hello" packet, giving information about itself. After this, the server replies with "server hello", followed by a *key exchange* to exchange SSL certificates. The client verifies the key/certificate and sends one of its own. After this, an encrypted *handshake* is initiated to confirm whether the encryption and transfer are working correctly. Once the handshake completes successfully, normal HTTP communication is continued, which is encrypted after that.
	* Depending on the circumstances, an attacker may be able to perform an *HTTP Downgrade Attack*, which downgrades HTTPS communication to HTTP, making the data transferred in clear-text. This is done by setting up a *Man-in-the-Middle* (MiTM) proxy to transfer all traffic through the attacker's host without the user's knowledge. 

#### cURL for HTTPS
* cURL should automatically handle all HTTPS communication standards and perform a secure handshake and then encrypt and decrypt data automatically. However, if we ever contact a website with an invalid SSL certificate or an outdated one, then cURL by default would not proceed with the communication to protect against a MiTM attack. Modern web browsers will often do the same warning users when visiting a. website with an invalid SSL certificate.
