## HTTP Fundamentals
### HyperText Transfer Protocol
* Today, the majority of the applications we constantly interact with the internet, both web and mobile applications
* Most Internet communications are made with web requests through the HTTP Protocol
	* HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources
	* The term *hypertext* stands for text containing links to other resources and text that readers can easily interpret
* HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the request and returns the requested resource.
	* The default port for HTTP communication is port *80*
* The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We enter a *Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)* as a *Uniform Resource Locator (URL)* to reach the desired website. Resources over HTTP are accessed via a URL
#### The Structure of A URL
![[Pasted image 20250313223849.png]]

| Component    | Example           | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme       | http:// https://  | This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash                                                                 |
| User Info    | admin:password@   | This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon) used to authenticate to the host, and is separated from the host with an at sign *@*      |
| Host         | inlanefreight.com | The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address                                                                                            |
| Port         | :80               | The Port is separated from the Host by a colon. If no port is specified, http schemes default to port *80* and https default to port *443*                                   |
| Path         | /dashboard.php    | This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index (e.g. *index.html*)         |
| Query String | ?login=true       | The query string starts with a question mark, and consists of a parameter (e.g. *login*) and a value (e.g. *true*). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand *&* |
| Fragments    | #status           | Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client side to location sections within the primary resource (e.g. a header or section on the page)                           |
* Not all components are required to access a resource. The main mandatory fields are the scheme and the host, without which the request would have no resource to request.

#### HTTP Flow
![[Pasted image 20250313225220.png]]
* The diagram above presents the anatomy of an HTTP request at a very high level. The first time a user enters the URL (*inlanefreight.com*) into the browser, it sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain and get its IP. The DNS server looks up an IP address for *inlanefreight.com* and returns it. All domain names need to be resolved this way, as a server can't communicate without an IP address. 
	* Browsers often look up records in the local */etc/hosts* file, and if the requested domain does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers. We can use the */etc/hosts* to manually add records to for DNS resolution, by adding the IP followed by the domain name. 
* Once the browser gets the IP address linked to the requested domain, it sends a *GET* request to the default HTTP port asking for the root */* path. Then the web server receives the request and processes it. By default, servers are configured to return an index file when a request for */* is received.
* In the diagram, the contents of *index.html* are read and returned by the web server as an HTTP response. The response also contains the status code (e.g. *200 OK*), which indicates that the request was successfully processed. The web browser then renders the index.html contents and presents it to the user.

#### cURL
* *cURL* (client URL) is a command-line tool and library that primarily supports HTTP along with many other protocols. This makes it a good candidate for scripts as well as automation, making it essential for sending various types of web requests from the command line, which is necessary for many types of web penetration tests.
* A Basic HTTP request to any URL can be done by providing the URL as an argument
```shell-session
greeneTea@htb[/htb]$ curl inlanefreight.com

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
...SNIP...
```
* cURL does not render the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code, unlike a web browser, but prints it in its raw format. Generally as a web penetration tester, we are more interested in the request and response context.
### HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
* A significant drawback to HTTP is that all data is transferred in clear-text. This means that anyone between the source and destination can perform a *Man-in-the-middle* (MiTM) attack to view the transferred data. 
* To resolve this issue, the *HTTPS (HTTP Secure) Protocol* was created, in which all communications are transferred in an encrypted format, so even if a third party does intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it. For this reason, HTTPS has become the mainstream scheme for websites on the Internet with HTTP being phased out.

#### HTTPS Overview
![[Pasted image 20250313232222.png]]
* Above is the PCAP of HTTP Traffic, we can see the login credentials can be viewed in clear-text making it easy for someone on the same network (such as a public wireless network) to capture the request and reuse the credentials for malicious purposes.
![[Pasted image 20250313232339.png]]
* In contrast, when someone intercepts and analyzes traffic from an HTTPS request, they would see something like the PCAP above. The data is transferred as a single encrypted stream making it difficult for anyone to capture information such as credentials or any other sensitive data.
	* Although data transferred through the HTTPS protocol may be encrypted, the request may still reveal the visited URL if it contacted a clear-text DNS server. For this reason, it is recommended to utilize encrypted DNS servers or utilize a VPN service to ensure all traffic is properly encrypted

#### HTTPS Flow
![[Pasted image 20250313234256.png]]
* If a user types *http://* instead of *https://* to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to resolve the domain and redirects the user to the web server hosting the target website. A request is sent to port *80* first, when is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the client to secure HTTPS port *443* instead. This is done via a *301 Moved Permanently* response code.
* The client (web browser) sends a "client hello" packet, giving information about itself. After this, the server replies with "server hello", followed by a *key exchange* to exchange SSL certificates. The client verifies the key/certificate and sends one of its own. After this, an encrypted *handshake* is initiated to confirm whether the encryption and transfer are working correctly. Once the handshake completes successfully, normal HTTP communication is continued, which is encrypted after that.
	* Depending on the circumstances, an attacker may be able to perform an *HTTP Downgrade Attack*, which downgrades HTTPS communication to HTTP, making the data transferred in clear-text. This is done by setting up a *Man-in-the-Middle* (MiTM) proxy to transfer all traffic through the attacker's host without the user's knowledge. 

#### cURL for HTTPS
* cURL should automatically handle all HTTPS communication standards and perform a secure handshake and then encrypt and decrypt data automatically. However, if we ever contact a website with an invalid SSL certificate or an outdated one, then cURL by default would not proceed with the communication to protect against a MiTM attack. Modern web browsers will often do the same warning users when visiting a. website with an invalid SSL certificate.
### HTTP Requests & Response
* HTTP communications mainly consist of an HTTP request and an HTTP response. An HTTP request is made by the client and is processed by the server. The request contains all the details we require from the server, including the resource, any request data, headers or options we specify, and many other options.

#### HTTP Request
![[Pasted image 20250314223519.png]]
* The image shows an HTTP GET request to the URL: *http:inlanefreight.com/users/login.html
* The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields 'separated by spaces'

| Field   | Example           | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Method  | GET               | The HTTP method or verb, which specifies the type of action to perform                                                |
| Path    | /users/login.html | The path to the resource being accessed.. This field can also be suffixed with a query string (e.g. *?username=user*) |
| Version | HTTP/1.1          | The third and final field is used to denote the HTTP version                                                          |
* The next set of lines contain HTTP header value pairs, like *Host*, *User-Agent*, *Cookie*, and many other possible headers. These headers are used to specify various attributes of a request. The headers are terminated with a new line, which is necessary for the server to validate the request. Lastly, a request may end with the request body and data. 
	* HTTP/1.X sends the request as clear-text, and uses a new-line character to separate different fields and different requests. HTTP/2.X sends requests as binary data in a dictionary form.

#### HTTP Response
![[Pasted image 20250314224411.png]]
The first line of an HTTP response contains two fields separated by spaces. The first being the *HTTP Version* (e.g. *HTTP/1.1*), and the second denotes the *HTTP response code* (e.g. *200 OK*). Response codes are used to determine the request's status, as will be discussed in a later section. After the first line, the response lists its headers, similar to an HTTP request. Both request and response headers are discussed in the next section. Lastly, the the response may end with a response body, which is separated by a new line after the headers and is usually defined as *HTML* code. 

#### Browser DevTools
* Most modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools which are mainly intended for developers to test their web applications. These tools can be leveraged by penetration testers as a vital asset in any web assessment you may perform. *F12* or *CTRL+SHIFT+I* will open developer tools in most browsers; developer tabs has multiple tabs, each of which has its own use, but we will focus on the *network* tab in this module. 

### HTTP Headers
* HTTP headers pass information between the client and the server. Some headers are used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common to both.
* Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:
	* General Headers
	* Entity Headers
	* Request Headers
	* Response Headers
	* Security Headers

#### General Headers
* *General Headers* are used in both HTTP requests and responses. They are contextual and are used to describe the message rather than its contents.

| Header     | Example                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date       | Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:30:44 GMT | Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It's preferred to convert the time to the standard UTC timezone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Connection | Connection: close                   | Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are *close* and *keep-alive*. The *close* value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the *keep-alive* header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input |
#### Entity Headers
* *Entity Headers* are used in both HTTP requests and responses. These headers are used to describe the content (entity) transferred by a message. They are usually found in responses and POST or PUT requests. 

| Header           | Example                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type     | Content-Type: text/html     | Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The *charset* field denotes the encoding standard, such as UTF-8      |
| Media-Type       | Media-Type: application/pdf | The media-type is similar to the Content-Type, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our output. The *charset* field may also be used with this header           |
| Boundary         | boundary="b4e4fbd93540"     | Acts as a marker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data, this boundary gets used as *--b4e4fbd93540* to separate different parts of the form                              |
| Content-Length   | Content-Length: 385         | Holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is automatically generated by the browser and tools like cURL                                         |
| Content-Encoding | Content-Encoding: gzip      | Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the *Content-Encoding* header |
#### Request Headers
* The client sends *Request Headers* in an HTTP transaction. These headers are used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content of the message. 

| Header        | Example                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host          | Host: www.inlanefreight.com            | Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server                                                                                |
| User-Agent    | User-Agent: curl/7.77.0                | The User-Agent header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Referer       | Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/ | Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make https://google.com the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences                                                                                                                                                            |
| Accept        | Accept: \*/\*                          | The Accept header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Cookie        | Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540         | Contains cookie-value pairs in the format *name=value*. A *cookie* is a piece of data stored on the client-side and on the server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client's access. Cookies can also server other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon |
| Authorization | Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK      | Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used                                                                                 |
#### Response Headers
* *Response Headers* can be used in an HTTP response and do not relate to the content. Certain response headers such as Age, Location, and Server are used to provide more context about the response. 

| Header           | Example                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server           | Server" Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)            | Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further              |
| Set-Cookie       | Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540       | Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the *Cookie* request header |
| WWW-Authenticate | WWW-Authenticate BASIC realm="localhost" | Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource                                                                                           |
#### Security Headers
* With the increase in the variety of browser and web-based attacks, defining certain headers that enhanced security were necessary. HTTP *Security Headers* are a class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies to be followed by the browser while accessing the website

| Header                    | Example                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Security-Policy   | Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'  | Dictates the website's policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing attacks such as XSS                            |
